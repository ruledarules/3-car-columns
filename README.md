# Frontend Mentor - 3-column preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [3-column preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/3column-preview-card-component-pH92eAR2-). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

- Working on this project made me take the time to apply relative units to my elements and take the time to understand them. I will keep working on it, but this was great practice.

- I got the chance to practice using media queries in this project. It came in handy.

### Continued development

I will continue to practice using relative units and improving on my responsive page design. I'll practice using flexbox and Grid.
