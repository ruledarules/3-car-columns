# Frontend Mentor - 3-column preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [3-column preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/3column-preview-card-component-pH92eAR2-). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

- Working on this project made me take the time to apply relative units to my elements and take the time to understand them. I will keep working on it, but this was great practice.

- I got the chance to practice using media queries in this project. It came in handy.

### Continued development

I will continue to practice using relative units and improving on my responsive page design. I'll practice using flexbox and Grid.

## Updates

Since the first submission, I realized that my mobile version was not clean and so I had to start fresh and develop the responsiveness of the page from the ground up. I had taken the time to learn how to take advantage of relative and responsive css units of measure to help.

## Thank you to Keven Powell

Using Kevin's resources and free videos, I was able to approach this second submission with a better understanding of the building responsive pages.
